# PRACTICAL DATA ANALYTICS
Interested in learning Data Analytics but not sure where to start? If so, then welcome to this repository. In this repository, I will be covering the fundamental concepts and tools necessary in the Data Analytics domain. We shall cover topics like data vizualization, statistics and data cleaning by implementing software(s) and tools like SQL, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Microsoft Excel, Power BI and Tableau.

### CHAPTER 1. TYPES OF DATA PLOTS FOR VISUALIZATION
Data visualization (often abbreviated data viz) is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the graphic representation of data. It is a particularly efficient way of communicating when the data is numerous. To communicate information clearly and efficiently, data visualization uses statistical graphics, plots, information graphics and other tools. Numerical data may be encoded using dots, lines, or bars, to visually communicate a quantitative message. Effective Visualization makes complex data more accessible, understandable, and usable. Data visualization refers to the techniques used to communicate data or information by encoding it as visual objects. The goal is to communicate information clearly and efficiently to users.
### 1. 1. Bar Chart
A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. A vertical bar chart is sometimes called a column chart. <br />
It shows comparisons among discrete categories. One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a measured value. Some bar graphs present bars clustered in groups of more than one, showing the values of more than one measured variable which we will be discussing in this Topic.

### 1. 2. Grouped Bar Chart
The grouped bar graph is also called the clustered bar graph, which is used to represent the discrete value for more than one object that shares the same category. In this type of bar chart, the total number of instances are combined into a single bar.
<br />
In other words, a grouped bar graph is a type of bar graph in which different sets of data items are compared. Here, a single colour is used to represent the specific series across the set. The grouped bar graph can be represented using both vertical and horizontal bar charts.

### 1. 3. Stacked Bar Chart
A stacked bar graph (or stacked bar chart) is a chart that uses bars to show comparisons between categories of data, but with ability to break down and compare parts of a whole. Each bar in the chart represents a whole, and segments in the bar represent different parts or categories of that whole.
<br />
Stacked bar charts are not suited to data sets having both positive and negative values since stacked bar charts present the information in the same sequence on each bar.

### 1. 4. Line Chart
A line graph is a unique graph which is commonly used in statistics. It represents the change in a quantity with respect to another quantity. This variation is usually plotted in a two-dimensional XY plane. If the relation including any two measures can be expressed utilizing a straight line in a graph, then such graphs are called line charts or line graphs.

### 1. 6. Simple and Exploded Pie Chart
A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic, which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice is proportional to the quantity it represents. Pie charts are often used in business. Examples include showing percentages of types of customers, percentage of revenue from different products, and profits from different countries. Pie charts can be helpful for showing the relationship of parts to the whole when there are a small number of levels.

### 1. 7. Scatter Plot
A scatter plot is a diagram drawn between two distributions of variables X and Y on a two dimensional plane. Scatter plot is used as an initial screening tool while analyzing two variables for any relationship (linear, non-linear, inverse relationships) that may exist between them.

### 1. 8. Bubble Chart
Bubble charts display data as a cluster of circles. The required data to create bubble chart needs to have the xy coordinates, size of the bubble and the colour of the bubbles. The colours can be supplied by the library itself. It is an extension of the scatter plot used to look at relationships between three numeric variables. Each dot in a bubble chart corresponds with a single data point, and the variables' values for each point are indicated by horizontal position, vertical position, and dot size.
