# PRACTICAL DATA ANALYTICS
Interested in learning Data Analytics but not sure where to start? If so, then welcome to this repository. In this repository, I will be covering the fundamental concepts and tools necessary in the Data Analytics domain. We shall cover topics like data vizualization, statistics and data cleaning by implementing software(s) and tools like SQL, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Microsoft Excel, Power BI and Tableau.

## CONTENTS
### CHAPTER 1. TYPES OF DATA PLOTS FOR VISUALIZATION
Data visualization (often abbreviated data viz) is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the graphic representation of data. It is a particularly efficient way of communicating when the data is numerous. To communicate information clearly and efficiently, data visualization uses statistical graphics, plots, information graphics and other tools. Numerical data may be encoded using dots, lines, or bars, to visually communicate a quantitative message. Effective Visualization makes complex data more accessible, understandable, and usable. Data visualization refers to the techniques used to communicate data or information by encoding it as visual objects. The goal is to communicate information clearly and efficiently to users.
### 1.1. Bar Chart
A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. A vertical bar chart is sometimes called a column chart. <br />
It shows comparisons among discrete categories. One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a measured value. Some bar graphs present bars clustered in groups of more than one, showing the values of more than one measured variable which we will be discussing in this Topic.

### 1.2. Grouped Bar Chart
The grouped bar graph is also called the clustered bar graph, which is used to represent the discrete value for more than one object that shares the same category. In this type of bar chart, the total number of instances are combined into a single bar.
<br />
In other words, a grouped bar graph is a type of bar graph in which different sets of data items are compared. Here, a single colour is used to represent the specific series across the set. The grouped bar graph can be represented using both vertical and horizontal bar charts.
